- I should pull out the date range checking parts into
a separate class, DateRange that checks for validity and
does comparisions (i think?) .. (i think that's what a 
lot of other people did?)

- I should reconsider whether there are good places to
use class methods or variables instead of instance 
methods or variables

- I should determine whether it's better to keep the 
room nightly_rate stored as a variable in each room 
or in the ManagementSystem

- For setting rates of rooms on instantiation I should
think about maybe a CLI that asks for info or a CSV 
that stores number of rooms, room numbers, nightly rate

- I need to change the status method in Room to a separate 
method, maybe moved into the future DateRange class, or maybe 
still in Room but separated out, so that I don't have to use 
basically a copy pasted version of checking conflicts between 
reservations and checking conflicts between dates.

- I think there's a better way to increase room/reservation/
block numbers instead of requiring the current length of rooms/
reservations/blocks being passed in, maybe those @@ variables 
Eve was showing me, or maybe something completely different, but 
for some reason I don't really like the way it looks with for
example Room instantiation needing the current length of rooms
to be passed in. IDK maybe it's fine.

- I feel like create_block is a really big method and I maybe 
created it too hastily, and it looks kind of messy and I bet it
can be trimmed down or moved into the Block class maybe? or at 
least trimmed down. I also think it's pretty readable right now 
though so I want to make sure not to lose that part of it.

- A lot of times I wasn't sure whether I should make methods in
Room/Block/Reservation or in ManagementSystem, so I would like to 
re-look at that after seeing other people's Hotels and learning 
more about OOP.
